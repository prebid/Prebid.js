# Release Schedule

We push a new release of Prebid.js every other week on Tuesday. During the adoption phase for 1.x, we are releasing updates for 1.x and 0.x at the same time.

While the releases will be available immediately for those using direct Git access,
it will be about a week before the Prebid Org [Download Page](http://prebid.org/download.html) will be updated.  

You can determine what is in a given build using the [releases page](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases)

Announcements regarding releases will be made to the #headerbidding-dev channel in subredditadops.slack.com.

# FAQs

**1. Is there flexibility in the 2-week schedule?**

If a major bug is found in the current release, a maintenance patch will be done as soon as possible.

It is unlikely that we will put out a maintenance patch at the request of a given bid adapter or module owner.

**2. What Pull Requests make it into a release?**

Every PR that's merged into master will be part of a release. Here are the [PR review guidelines](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/master/PR_REVIEW.md).
