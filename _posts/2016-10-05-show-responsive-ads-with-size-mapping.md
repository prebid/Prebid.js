Prebid is making it easier for you to adjust ad sizes based on the device's screen width.  Using the new size mapping feature, you can:

- Change ad sizes depending on the user's screen size 

- Use declarative syntax during ad unit setup

- Avoid adding tricky custom logic to your code

For more information, [see the example code here]({{site_url}}/dev-docs/examples/size-mapping.html).
