about: 
- Postbid is a third-party tag creative you setup in your ad server. Create one line item in the ad server targeting each ad unit on your page. This line item's <strong>creative will contain the code below</strong>.
- If your ad unit supports multiple sizes, create multiple Postbid creatives for each size. 
- There is no need to create line items for each price bucket as the postbid creative is served after the ad server has chosen the line item. 
- This postbid creative <strong>supports passback</strong>. See how this works below.
