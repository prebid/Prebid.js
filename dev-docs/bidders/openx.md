{: .table .table-bordered .table-striped }
| Name | Scope | Description | Example |

| `delDomain` | required | OpenX delivery domain provided by your OpenX representative.  | "PUBLISHER-d.openx.net" |
| `customParams` | optional | User-defined targeting key-value pairs. customParams applies to a specific unit. | `{key1: "v1", key2: ["v2","v3"]}` |
| `customFloor` | optional | Minimum price in USD. customFloor applies to a specific unit. For example, use the following value to set a $1.50 floor: 1.50 | 1.50 |


### Configuration
Add the following code to enable user syncing. By default, Prebid.js version 0.34.0+ turns off user syncing through iframes. OpenX strongly recommends enabling user syncing through iframes. This functionality improves DSP user match rates and increases the OpenX bid rate and bid price. Be sure to call `pbjs.setConfig()` only once.

```javascript
pbjs.setConfig({
   userSync: {
      iframeEnabled: true
   }
});
```
