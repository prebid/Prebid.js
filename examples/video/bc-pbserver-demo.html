            Because we have no way of knowing when all the bids will be
            returned from Prebid we can't be sure that the browser will
            reach the point where `invokeVideoPlayer` is defined before
            `bidsBackHandler` fires and tries to call it.

            To prevent an "`invokeVideoPlayer` not defined" error, we
            pre-define it before we make the call to Prebid, and redefine
            it later on with the code to create the player and play the
            ad.

            In this first version, it simply stores the winning VAST to
            use later. */

            and play the ad.

            If `tempTag` is not defined, that means the browser reached
            the end of the page before the bids came back from prebid,
