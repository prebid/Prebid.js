# Need Help?
{:.no_toc}

There are several ways to ask for help or get involved with Prebid.  See below for more information.

## Overview

For technical & feature requests or questions, it's best to use the GitHub or Stack Overflow forums. Prebid is worked on full-time by engineering teams from AppNexus and Rubicon Project.  There are also many publishers using and contributing to the project.

For questions about how an adapter works, it's best to reach out to the company directly, or ask on Github. Each demand adapter should be maintained by the SSPs or exchange behind that adapter.

For Prebid news or general questions, we recommend the Ad Ops Slack Channel, Quora, or Twitter.

There are consulting and service companies that will install & maintain Prebid on a publisher's behalf.  
We're working on getting a comprehensive list of these providers to share here.  
If you're one of these companies, please email us at [support@prebid.org](mailto:support@prebid.org).
