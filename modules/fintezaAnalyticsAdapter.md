# Description

The Finteza adapter for integration with Prebid is an analytics tool for publishers who use the Header Bidding technology.

All tracks are sent to Finteza and enable visual advertiser quality evaluation: how many offers partners accept, what prices they provide, how fast they respond and how often their bids win.
