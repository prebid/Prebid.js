# ID5 Universal ID

The ID5 Universal ID is a shared, neutral identifier that publishers and ad tech platforms can use to recognise users even in environments where 3rd party cookies are not available. The ID5 Universal ID is designed to respect users' privacy choices and publishersâ€™ preferences throughout the advertising value chain. For more information about the ID5 Universal ID and detailed integration docs, please visit [our documentation](https://support.id5.io/portal/en/kb/articles/prebid-js-user-id-module).

# ID5 Analytics Registration

The ID5 Analytics Adapter is free to use during our Beta period, but requires a simple registration with ID5. Please visit [id5.io/universal-id](https://id5.io/universal-id) to sign up and request your ID5 Partner Number to get started. If you're already using the ID5 Universal ID, you may use your existing Partner Number with the analytics adapter.
