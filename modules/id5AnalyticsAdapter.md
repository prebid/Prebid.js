# ID5 Universal ID

The ID5 Universal ID is a shared, neutral identifier that publishers and ad tech platforms can use to recognise users even in environments where 3rd party cookies are not available. The ID5 Universal ID is designed to respect users' privacy choices and publishersâ€™ preferences throughout the advertising value chain. For more information about the ID5 Universal ID and detailed integration docs, please visit [our documentation](https://wiki.id5.io/x/BIAZ). We also recommend that you sign up for our [release notes](https://id5.io/universal-id/release-notes) to stay up-to-date with any changes to the implementation of the ID5 Universal ID in Prebid.
