The purpose of this Real Time Data Provider is to allow publishers to target against their JW Player media without 
having to integrate with the Player Bidding product. This prebid module makes JW Player's video ad targeting information accessible 
to Bid Adapters.

#Usage for Publishers:

Compile the JW Player RTD Provider into your Prebid build:

`gulp build --modules=jwplayerRtdProvider`

Publishers must register JW Player as a real time data provider by setting up a Prebid Config conformant to the 
following structure:

```javascript
const jwplayerDataProvider = {
  name: "jwplayer"
};

pbjs.setConfig({
    ...,
    realTimeData: {
      dataProviders: [
          jwplayerDataProvider
      ]
    }
});
```
Lastly, include the content's media ID and/or the player's ID in the matching AdUnit's `fpd.context.data`:

```javascript
const adUnit = {
  code: '/19968336/prebid_native_example_1',
  ...
  fpd: {
    context: {
      data: {
        jwTargeting: {
          // Note: the following Ids are placeholders and should be replaced with your Ids.
          playerID: 'abcd',
          mediaID: '1234'
        }
      }
    }
  }
};

pbjs.que.push(function() {
    pbjs.addAdUnits([adUnit]);
    pbjs.requestBids({
        ...
    });
});
``` 

**Note**: You may also include `jwTargeting` information in the prebid config's `fpd.context.data`. Information provided in the adUnit will always supersede, and information in the config will be used as a fallback.
 
##Prefetching
In order to prefetch targeting information for certain media, include the media IDs in the `jwplayerDataProvider` var and set `waitForIt` to `true`:

```javascript
const jwplayerDataProvider = {
  name: "jwplayer",
  waitForIt: true,
  params: {
    mediaIDs: ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']
  }
};
```

You must also set a value to `auctionDelay` in the config's `realTimeData` object 

```javascript
realTimeData = {
  auctionDelay: 100,
  ...
};
```

#Usage for Bid Adapters:

Implement the `buildRequests` function. When it is called, the `bidRequests` param will be an array of bids.
Each bid for which targeting information was found will conform to the following object structure:

```javascript
{
    adUnitCode: 'xyz',
    bidId: 'abc',
    ...,
    jwTargeting: {
      segments: ['123', '456'],
      content: {
        id: 'jw_abc123'
      }
    }
}
```

where:
- `segments` is an array of jwpseg targeting segments, of type string.
- `content` is an object containing metadata for the media. It may contain the following information: 
  - `id` is a unique identifier for the specific media asset.
  
**Example:**

To view an example:
 
- in your cli run:

`gulp serve --modules=jwplayerRtdProvider`

- in your browser, navigate to:

`http://localhost:9999/integrationExamples/gpt/jwplayerRtdProvider_example.html`

**Note:** the mediaIds in the example are placeholder values; replace them with your existing IDs.
