# Adding OpenX Analytics Adapter to Prebid.js
A Publisher has two options to add the OpenX Analytics Adapter to Prebid.js:

1. [Publisher builds the Prebid.js file](#publisher-builds-prebid.js-file-flow): If the Publisher is familiar with building Prebid.js (through the command line and not through the download site), OpenX can provide to the Publisher only the Analytics Adapter code.

2. [OpenX builds the Prebid.js file](#openx-builds-prebid.js-file-flow): If the Publisher is unfamiliar with building Prebid.js, the Publisher should advise OpenX which modules to include by going to the [Prebid download site](http://prebid.org/download.html) and selecting all the desired items (adapters and modules) for OpenX.

---

## Publisher Builds Prebid.js File Flow
Use this option if the Publisher is building the Prebid.js file.

1. OpenX sends Publisher the new Analytics Adapter code.

2. Publisher replaces the file in `<path_to_prebid.js_folder>/modules/openxAnalyticsAdapter.js` with the file provided by OpenX.

3. Publisher runs the build command in `<path_to_prebid.js_folder>` and includes `openxAnalyticsAdapter` as one of the modules to include.

    For example:

    ```shell
    gulp build --modules=openxBidAdapter,rubiconBidAdapter,sovrnBidAdapter,openxBidAdapter,openxAnalyticsAdapter,dfpAdServerVideo
    ```

4. Publisher deploys the Prebid.js file from `<path_to_prebid.js_folder>/build/dist/prebid.js` to a website.

---

## OpenX Builds Prebid.js File Flow
Use this option if OpenX is building the Prebid.js file on behalf of the Publisher.

1. Publisher refers to the [Prebid download site](http://prebid.org/download.html) and sends a list of adapters and modules to OpenX.

    >Note: The Publisher must be aware that only Prebid 3.0+ is supported.

    For example (does not have to follow exact format):

    ```yaml
    Prebid Version: 3.10+
    Modules:
      Bidders
        OpenX
        Rubicon
        Sovrn
      Consent Management
        US Privacy
      User ID
        IdentityLink ID
      DFP Video
      Supply Chain Object
      Currency
    ```

2. OpenX uses the information to build a package to the user’s specification and includes `openxAnalyticsAdapter` as an additional module.

3. OpenX sends the built package to the Publisher.

4. Publisher deploys the modified Prebid.js to a website.

# Website Configuration
To configure your website, add the following code snippet to your website:

```javascript
pbjs.que.push(function () {
  pbjs.enableAnalytics([{
    provider: "openx",
    options: {
        publisherPlatformId: "OPENX_PROVIDED_PLATFORM_ID", // eg: "a3aece0c-9e80-4316-8deb-faf804779bd1"
        publisherAccountId: PUBLISHER_ACCOUNT_ID, // eg: 537143056
        sampling: 0.05, // 5% sample rate
        testCode: 'test-code-1'
    }
  }]);
});
```

## Configuration Options
Configuration options are a follows:

| Property | Type | Required? | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `publisherPlatformId` | `string` | Yes | Used to determine ownership of data. | `a3aece0c-9e80-4316-8deb-faf804779bd1` |
| `publisherAccountId` | `number` | Yes | Used to determine ownership of data. | `1537143056` |
| `sampling` | `number` | Yes | Sampling rate | Undefined or `1.00` - No sampling. Analytics is sent all the time.<br>0.5 - 50% of users will send analytics data. |
| `testCode` | `string` | No | Used to label analytics data for the purposes of tests.<br>This label is treated as a dimension and can be compared against other labels. | `timeout_config_1`<br>`timeout_config_2`<br>`timeout_default` |
